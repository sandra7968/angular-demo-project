 ANGULAR - FrontEnd Technology : Single Page Application
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Basic Commands
 ----------------

 1. to create project: ng new project-name
 2. to run project: ng serve
 3. to create new component: ng g c component-name
 4. to create service: ng g s service-folder-name/service-name

 Basic Features
 -----------------

 1. Module: Used to hold multiple components and helps import packages to design Page
 2. Components: A part of UI, consist of html,css and ts file and its selector to use it in another page - Root Component : AppComponent
 3. Decorator: to add meta data (data inside another data), indicated using @
 4. Selectors: to display component design in another html file
 5. Data Binding: Data sharing within a component (html,ts file)
       - One way Binding: 
              - component(ts) to view (html)
                  - string interpolation : use {{property-name}} in html page
                  - property Binding: bind class property with html tag attribute - [attribute] = "property-name"
              - view (html) to component(ts)
                  - event Binding: use (event-name)="function-call"
                  - event Binding using $event : use (event-name)="function-name($event)" - to get events in ts file
                  - event Binding template reference variable: use #variable-name
       - Two way Binding: Data sharing in both directions at the same time
              - Template driven forms: form will design in html first
                  - import FormsModule in Module file
                  - use ngModel attribute: syntax - [(ngModel)]="class property", if its inside form tag, must set name attribute of that input tag
              - Model driven forms: first create form model in ts file
 6. To set up path for component
       - define routes in routing.Module ts file
              - syntax: {path:'',component:component-name}
       - use router-out;et selector in root component
 7. routerLink to redirect from one component to another in tag
 8. Dependency Injection: when a component and a predefined class are dependent then dependent class instance can be assigned to other class un their constructor
       - syntax: constructor(access-specifier component-property:dependent classname){}
 9. Angular Services: used to define common logic that can be accessed or shared by any component/classes
 10. Directives: to provide additional behaviours to html elements. It should start with * symbol
       - Component Directives: same as component selector which is used to view its html in other page
       - Structural Directives: used to change html structure by adding or removing html items
              - *ngIf=(condition) attribute: based on a condition to display html elements
              - *ngFor=let variable-name of array-name: render a list
              - *ngSwitch
       - Attribute Directives: used to provide style to html elements
